Clarifications:

- is each rake client finding and running a single Rakefile 
- what to do with port number
- store output values, will it be referenced/called again?
- are we developing our own bind() and accept() functions,
  or are we calling pre-existing bind() and accept()
- can we use system() in rake-c

* rake client cannot defer ' ' and '\t'
